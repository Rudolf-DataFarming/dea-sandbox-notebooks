    "\n",
    "Welcome to FrontierSI’s Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Sandbox. Here you can access an instance of the Open Data Cube (ODC) that has data indexed and ready to go. This sandbox utilises data products that Geoscience Australia have made available on their public S3 storage. Those who code in Python and want to explore the potential of DEA products using the ODC can use this space to explore its use. And for the novice users we've developed prototype apps that allow you to explore any location in Australia in a simple way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The apps that have been prepared utilise the ODC, which is an open source library that provides an integrated gridded data analysis environment capable of delivering decades of analysis ready earth observation satellite and related data from multiple satellite and other acquisition systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ODC manual can be found at http://datacube-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\n",
