    "# FrontierSI's DEA Sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to FrontierSI’s Jupyter Hub sandbox, we have spun up our own instance of ODC and indexed products that Geoscience Australia have made available on their public s3 storage. Those who code in python and want to explore the potential of DEA products and it's accompanying ODC api can use this space to explore it's use. And for the novice users we've developed proto-type apps that to allow users to explore any location in Australia through products that will be available as part of DEA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The apps utilise the OpenDataCube (ODC) which is an opensource library that provides an integrated gridded data analysis environment capable of delivering decades of analysis ready earth observation satellite and related data from multiple satellite and other acquisition systems.\n",
