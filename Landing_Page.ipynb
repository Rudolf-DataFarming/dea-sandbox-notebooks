    "Welcome to FrontierSIâ€™s ODC Sandbox. Here you can access an instance of the Open Data Cube (ODC) that has data indexed and ready to go. This sandbox utilises data products available on s3 AWS pds-bucket (https://docs.opendata.aws/landsat-pds/readme.html). \n",

    "Those who code in Python can use this space to explore using the ODC api to interact with indexed products and the potential of accessing earth observation data on demand. \n",

    "And for the novice users we've developed prototype apps that allow you to explore any location in thw world in a simple way graphical user interface that is called using macro commands - read on.\n",

    "The ODC initiative seeks to increase the value and impact of global Earth obervation satellite data by providing an open and freely accessible exploitation archectecture and to foster a community to develop, sustain, and grow the techonology and the breadth and depth of its application.
